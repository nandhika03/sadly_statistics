    "# **Reliability and Validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reliabiltiy is the nothing but the value that measures the consistency of a test\n",
    "- The test is said to be reliable only when it can be trusted and tested for consistency\n",
    "- A test cannot be valid without being reliable\n",
    "- Observed score = true score + error score\n",
    "- We try to minimize the error value here\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Test-retest reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, the test is checked if it gives same or similar results over a period of time with the same test and same test takers involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parallel forms of reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We check the equivalnce or similarity of different forms of the same test\n",
    "- A test can be taken over a period of 2 days in two different forms\n",
    "- We should make sure that both these forms are similiar to one another\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Internal consistency reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we make sure that each item of the test measures the same dimension/construct or thing\n",
    "- The individual test scores are correlated with the total test scores and then it is compared with the overall variability of the total test scores\n",
    "- It is measured using different values like:\n",
    "     - Cronbach's alpha\n",
    "     - Spearman - Brown\n",
    "     - KR 20 and KR 21 (Kuder Richardsons)\n",
    "     - split - half reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interrater reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we check the consistency or similarity between the judges or people who rate a particular construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Coefficient of reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The co-efficient of reliability is always positive and the higher it is the more reliable the test is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What happens when we struggle to establish reliability?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardize the testing methods\n",
    "- Increase the sample size of observations\n",
    "- Delete the unclear observations\n",
    "- Moderate the level of easeness or difficulty of the test\n",
    "- Decrease the effect of confounding variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we check if the test measures what it indents to measure\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Content validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we check if the sample of the test items actually represent the universe of the testing construct or dimension.\n",
    "- The questions in a history test should actually check the knowledge of the students in the domain of histoty\n",
    "- Having a subject matter expert is crucial for content validity\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Criterion validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we check if the criteria in the test actually goes well with what we are testing\n",
    "- We may have both concurrent(present) and predictive(future) criterion validity\n",
    "- We might want to check if the criteria is good by correlating it with judegs or expert's opinion\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Construct validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the most difficult validity to establish\n",
    "- Here, we have to establish that our theory about some matter would actually (scientifically) be a good measurement for a particular behavior or attitude.\n",
    "- This can take years to achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - The maximum level of validity = sqaure root (reliability co-efficient)\n",
