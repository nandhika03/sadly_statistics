# sadly_statistics
As a person who dislikes statistics, this is my journey towards disliking it even more!

"Statistics for people who (think) that they hate Statistics" [Edition 6] is the book that I will leaning on throughtout this repo. The book can be downloaded from the website link provided in the resources section of this page.

PART I
- This includes the basics of statistics including measure of central tendency, variability and correlation
- The data set that has been used here is titled as 'Student life' which can be found on Kaggle
- The content in the notebook is like a reduction or what I would like to call 'me explaining to my brain in the dumbest language I know'. So, inorder to better understand, please do refer the book mentioned in the resources.
- Dataset used: dataset\education\grades.csv
- As, the grades are numerical values it is intended to be used for the measures of central tendency
- Dealing with discontinuties in data is also discussed here

Dataset:
- The description of the dataset can be found in the kaggle link.
- It includes data collected from a mobile application called 'Student Life' to gain insights on the Behavioural traits of students.
- It also includes data from wearables.
- As stated in the description from Kaggle, this is also " the first study that used
 passive and automatic sensing data from the phones of a class of 48 Dartmouth students over a 10 week term to assess their mental health"
- It also questions the relationship between student grades and their behavioral and environmental aspects
- The dataset consists of various datasets ranging from the sleep data in .json format to the stress levels and PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Scale) in the .csv format
